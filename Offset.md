# Offset #

The offset can be included as a parameter in the music tag, such as: `{music offset="number"}`. Offset 0 is the default if this parameter is not included in the music tag. The offset is used to determine which music files to display.

You might be tempted to use this for pagination, but there is a [better parameter for that](Pagination.md).
