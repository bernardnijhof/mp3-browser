# Rendering for Mobile #

The music items can either be rendered:

  * Using `div` elements
  * `table` element with rows and cells (default, see [screen shot](ScreenShot.md))
  * `table` element by default, only using `div` elements for selected template; a template can be chosen. Set this to the template used for mobile visitors, so that for mobile visitors the music items are rendered as `div` elements, and thus looks much better than as a `table` does on mobile devices
